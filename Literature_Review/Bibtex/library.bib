abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

@article{Pritchard2014,
abstract = {We report on a survey of astronomers asking questions at the most recent National Astronomy Meeting (NAM2014). The gender balance of both speakers and session chairs at NAM (31% and 29% women respectively) closely matched that of attendees (28% female). However, we find that women were under-represented among question askers (just 18% female). Women were especially under-represented in asking the first question (only 14% of first questions asked by women), but when the Q&A session reached four or more questions, women and men were observed to ask roughly equal numbers of questions. We found a small, but statistically insignificant, increase in the fraction of questions from women in sessions where the chair was also female. On average $2.2\pm0.1$ questions were asked per talk, with no detectable difference in the number of questions asked of female and male speakers, but on average female chairs solicited slightly fewer questions than male chairs. We compare these results to a similar study by Davenport et al. (2014) for the AAS, who also found under-representation of women amongst question askers, but saw more pronounced gender effects when a session chair or speaker were female. We conclude with suggestions for improving the balance of questions at future astronomy meetings.},

@article{Bell2000,
abstract = {We have used a large sample of low-inclination spiral galaxies with radially resolved optical and near-infrared photometry to investigate trends in star formation history with radius as a function of galaxy structural parameters. A maximum-likelihood method was used to match all the available photometry of our sample to the colours predicted by stellar population synthesis models. The use of simplistic star formation histories, uncertainties in the stellar population models and considering the importance of dust all compromise the absolute ages and metallicities derived in this work; however, our conclusions are robust in a relative sense. We find that most spiral galaxies have stellar population gradients, in the sense that their inner regions are older and more metal rich than their outer regions. Our main conclusion is that the surface density of a galaxy drives its star formation history, perhaps through a local density dependence in the star formation law. The mass of a galaxy is a less important parameter; the age of a galaxy is relatively unaffected by its mass; however, the metallicity of galaxies depends on both surface density and mass. This suggests that galaxymass-dependent feedback is an important process in the chemical evolution of galaxies. In addition, there is significant cosmic scatter suggesting that mass and density may not be the only parameters affecting the star formation history of a galaxy.},

abstract = {We present initial results of a deep near-IR spectroscopic survey covering the 15 fields of the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) using MOSFIRE on the Keck 1 telescope, focusing on a sample of 251 galaxies with redshifts 2.0< z < 2.6, star-formation rates 2 < SFR < 200 M_sun/yr, and stellar masses 8.6 < log(M*/M_sun) < 11.4, with high-quality spectra in both H- and K-band atmospheric windows. We show unambiguously that the locus of z$\sim$2.3 galaxies in the "BPT" nebular diagnostic diagram exhibits a disjoint, yet similarly tight, relationship between the ratios [NII]6585/Halpha and [OIII]/Hbeta as compared to local galaxies. Using photoionization models, we argue that the offset of the z$\sim$2.3 locus relative to z$\sim$ 0 is explained by a combination of harder ionizing radiation field, higher ionization parameter, and higher N/O at a given O/H than applies to most local galaxies, and that the position of a galaxy along the z$\sim$2.3 star-forming BPT locus is surprisingly insensitive to gas-phase oxygen abundance. The observed nebular emission line ratios are most easily reproduced by models in which the net ionizing radiation field resembles a blackbody with effective temperature T_eff = 50000-60000 K and N/O close to the solar value at all O/H. We critically assess the applicability of commonly-used strong line indices for estimating gas-phase metallicities, and consider the implications of the small intrinsic scatter in the empirical relationship between excitation-sensitive line indices and stellar mass (i.e., the "mass-metallicity" relation), at z$\sim$2.3.},

@article{Pacifici2014,
abstract = {Interpreting observations of distant galaxies in terms of constraints on physical parameters - such as stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR) and dust optical depth - requires spectral synthesis modelling. We analyse the reliability of these physical parameters as determined under commonly adopted `classical' assumptions: star-formation histories assumed to be exponentially declining functions of time, a simple dust law and no emission-line contribution. Improved modelling techniques and data quality now allow us to use a more sophisticated approach, including realistic star-formation histories, combined with modern prescriptions for dust attenuation and nebular emission (Pacifici et al. 2012). We present a Bayesian analysis of the spectra and multi-wavelength photometry of 1048 galaxies from the 3D-HST survey in the redshift range 0.7<z<2.8 and in the stellar mass range 9<log(M/Mo)<12. We find that, using the classical spectral library, stellar masses are systematically overestimated ($\sim$0.1 dex) and SFRs are systematically underestimated ($\sim$0.6 dex) relative to our more sophisticated approach. We also find that the simultaneous fit of photometric fluxes and emission-line equivalent widths helps break a degeneracy between SFR and optical depth of the dust, reducing the uncertainties on these parameters. Finally, we show how the biases of classical approaches can affect the correlation between stellar mass and SFR for star-forming galaxies (the `Star-Formation Main Sequence'). We conclude that the normalization, slope and scatter of this relation strongly depend on the adopted approach and demonstrate that the classical, oversimplified approach cannot recover the true distribution of stellar mass and SFR.},

@article{Kewley2013,
abstract = {We compare a large sample of galaxies between 0.5<z<2.6 with theoretical predictions for how the optical diagnostic line ratios in galaxy ensembles change as a function of cosmic time. We show that star forming galaxies at high redshift (z>1.5) are consistent with a model in which the ISM conditions are more extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of local galaxies. We speculate that global spectra of our high redshift galaxies may be dominated by HII regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-forming complexes in the Antennae and M82. The transition to local-type conditions occurs between 0.8<z<1.5. We conclude that classification schemes developed for local samples should not be applied at high redshift (z > 1.5). We use our theoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line that utilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [OIII]/H-beta and [NII]/H-alpha. Our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies from AGN between z=0 to z$\sim$3.5. We anticipate that our redshift-dependent optical classification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We apply our classification line to a sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z$\sim$2.5. Although limited by small numbers, we show that our classification line is consistent with the position of AGN that have been independently confirmed via other methods.},

@article{Fioc1997,
abstract = {PEGASE (Projet d'Etude des GAlaxies par Synthese Evolutive, in French) is a new spectrophotometric evolution model for starbursts and evolved galaxies of the Hubble sequence. Its main originality is the extension to the near-infrared (NIR) of the atlas of synthetic spectra of Rocca-Volmerange &amp; Guiderdoni (1988A&amp;AS...75...93R) with a revised stellar library including cold star parameters and stellar tracks extended to the thermally-pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) and the post-AGB (PAGB) phase. The NIR is coherently linked to the visible and the ultraviolet (UV), so that the model is continuous on an exceptionally large wavelength range from 220\AA up to 5$\mu$m. Moreover, a precise algorithm allows to follow very rapid evolutionary phases such as red supergiants or AGB crucial in the NIR. The nebular component is also computed in the NIR. The extinction correction is gas-dependent for spirals and ellipticals. A set of reference synthetic spectra at z=0, to which apply cosmological k- and evolution e- corrections for high-redshift galaxies, is built from fits of observational templates. Because of the lack of visible to NIR spectral templates for each Hubble type, we adopt statistical samples of colors, not fitted by previous models. A first application of this continuous model is to solve the problem of the slope of the bright galaxy counts from B=15 to 19 and of the normalization parameter $\phi$_*_ of the Schechter luminosity function. Designed to be used currently and to take into account easily new observational and theoretical inputs, the model is built as a series of independent blocks. Any block is clearly identified and submitted to publication. Code sources, input and output data are available by anonymous ftp at ftp.iap.fr in /pub/from_users/pegase/ or at the WEB address of the authors: http://www.iap.fr/users/.},

abstract = {We present the results from a survey of 12CO emission in 40 luminous sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs), with 850-$\mu$m fluxes of S850 $\mu$m = 4-20 mJy, conducted with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. We detect 12CO emission in 32 SMGs at z ˜ 1.2-4.1, including 16 SMGs not previously published. Using multiple 12CO line (Jup = 2-7) observations, we derive a median spectral line energy distribution for luminous SMGs. We report the discovery of a fundamental relationship between 12CO FWHM and 12CO line luminosity in high-redshift starbursts, which we interpret as a natural consequence of the baryon-dominated dynamics within the regions probed by our observations. We use far-infrared luminosities to assess the star formation efficiency in our SMGs, finding that the slope of the L'CO-LFIR relation is close to linear. We derive molecular gas masses, finding a mean gas mass of (5.3 ± 1.0) × 1010 M⊙. Combining these with dynamical masses, we determine the redshift evolution of the gas content of SMGs, finding that they do not appear to be significantly more gas rich than less vigorously star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. Finally, we collate X-ray observations, and study the interdependence of gas and dynamical properties of SMGs with their AGN activity and supermassive black hole masses (MBH), finding that SMGs lie significantly below the local MBH-$\sigma$ relation.},

@article{Mannucci2010,
abstract = {ABSTRACT We show that the mass-metallicity relation observed in the local universe is due to a more general relation between stellar mass M*, gas-phase metallicity and star formation rate (SFR). Local galaxies define a tight surface in this 3D space, the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), with a small residual dispersion of $\sim$0.05 dex in metallicity, i.e. $\sim$12 per cent. At low stellar mass, metallicity decreases sharply with increasing SFR, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does not depend on SFR. High-redshift galaxies up to z $\sim$ 2.5 are found to follow the same FMR defined by local Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies, with no indication of evolution. In this respect, the FMR defines the properties of metal enrichment of galaxies in the last 80 per cent of cosmic time. The evolution of the mass-metallicity relation observed up to z = 2.5 is due to the fact that galaxies with progressively higher SFRs, and therefore lower metallicities, are selected at increasing redshifts, sampling different parts of the same FMR. By introducing the new quantity $\mu$$\alpha$ = log (M*) - $\alpha$ log (SFR), with $\alpha$ = 0.32, we define a projection of the FMR that minimizes the metallicity scatter of local galaxies. The same quantity also cancels out any redshift evolution up to z $\sim$ 2.5, i.e. all galaxies follow the same relation between $\mu$0.32 and metallicity and have the same range of values of $\mu$0.32. At z > 2.5, evolution of about 0.6 dex off the FMR is observed, with high-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. The existence of the FMR can be explained by the interplay of infall of pristine gas and outflow of enriched material. The former effect is responsible for the dependence of metallicity with SFR and is the dominant effect at high redshift, while the latter introduces the dependence on stellar mass and dominates at low redshift. The combination of these two effects, together with the Schmidt-Kennicutt law, explains the shape of the FMR and the role of $\mu$0.32. The small-metallicity scatter around the FMR supports the smooth infall scenario of gas accretion in the local universe.},

@article{Papovich2001,
abstract = {Using deep near-infrared and optical observations of the Hubble Deep Field-North from the Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS and WFPC2 instruments and from the ground, we examine the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at 2.0<$\sim$z<$\sim$3.5 in order to investigate their stellar population properties. The ultraviolet-optical rest-frame SEDs of the galaxies are much bluer than those of present-day spiral and elliptical galaxies and are generally similar to those of local starburst galaxies with modest amounts of reddening. We use stellar population synthesis models to study the properties of the stars that dominate the light from LBGs. Under the assumption that the star formation rate is continuous or decreasing with time, the best-fitting models provide a lower bound on the LBG mass estimates. LBGs with ``L*'' UV luminosities are estimated to have minimum stellar masses $\sim$1010 Msolar, or roughly 1/10 that of a present-day L* galaxy, similar to the mass of the Milky Way bulge. By considering the photometric effects of a second stellar population component of maximally old stars, we set an upper bound on the stellar masses that is $\sim$3-8 times the minimum mass estimate. The stellar masses derived for bright LBGs are similar to published estimates of their dynamical masses based on nebular emission line widths, suggesting that such kinematic measurements may substantially underestimate the total masses of the dark matter halos. We find only loose constraints on the individual galaxy ages, extinction, metallicities, initial mass functions, and prior star formation histories. Most LBGs are well fitted by models with population ages that range from 30 Myr to $\sim$1 Gyr, although for models with subsolar metallicities a significant minority of galaxies are well fitted by very young (<$\sim$10 Myr), very dusty stellar populations, A(1700 {\AA})>2.5 mag. We find no galaxies whose SEDs are consistent with young (<$\sim$108 yr), dust-free objects, which suggests that LBGs are not dominated by ``first-generation'' stars and that such objects are rare at these redshifts. We also find that the typical ages for the observed star formation events are significantly younger than the time interval covered by this redshift range ($\sim$1.5 Gyr). From this, and from the relative absence of candidates for quiescent, non-star-forming galaxies at these redshifts in the NICMOS data that might correspond to the fading remnants of galaxies formed at higher redshift, we suggest that star formation in LBGs may be recurrent, with short duty cycles and a timescale between star formation events of <$\sim$1 Gyr. Based on observations taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

We demonstrate that the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563 luminosity is a reliable SFR tracer even in highly obscured star-forming galaxies. We find that variations in dust reddening dominate the systematic uncertainty in SFRs derived from the observed H$\beta$, [O II], and U-band luminosities, producing a factor of $\sim$1.7, $\sim$2.5, and $\sim$2.1 scatter in the mean transformations, respectively. We show that [O II] depends weakly on variations in oxygen abundance over a wide range in metallicity, 12+log(O/H)=8.15-8.7 (Z/Zsolar=0.28-1.0), and that in this metallicity interval galaxies occupy a narrow range in ionization parameter (-3.8<$\sim$logU<$\sim$-2.9). We show that the scatter in [O III] $\lambda$5007 as a SFR indicator is a factor of 3-4 due to its sensitivity to metal abundance and ionization. We develop empirical SFR calibrations for H$\beta$ and [O II] parameterized in terms of the B-band luminosity, which remove the systematic effects of reddening and metallicity and reduce the SFR scatter to +/-40% and +/-90%, respectively, although individual galaxies may deviate substantially from the median relations. Finally, we compare the z$\sim$0 relations between blue luminosity and reddening, ionization, and [O II]/H$\alpha$ ratio against measurements at z$\sim$1 and find broad agreement. We emphasize, however, that optical emission-line measurements including H$\alpha$ for larger samples of intermediate- and high-redshift galaxies are needed to test the applicability of our locally derived SFR calibrations to distant galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of $\sim$ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-\AA break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

In addition, IR luminosities, L(IRs), colors, and warm dust masses were derived for these galaxies and were compared with the interstellar gas masses and optical luminosities of the galaxies. It was found that, for galaxies whose optical diameter measures between 5 and 8 arcmin, the PSC flux densities are underestimated by a factor of 2 at 60 microns, and by a factor of 1.5 at 100 microns. It was also found that, for 49 galaxies, the mass of warm dust correlated well with the H2 mass, and that L(IR) correlated with L(H-alpha), demonstrating that the L(IR) measures the rate of star formation in these galaxies.},

abstract = {It has recently been suggested that galaxies in the early Universe could have grown through the accretion of cold gas, and that this may have been the main driver of star formation and stellar mass growth. Because the cold gas is essentially primordial, it has a very low abundance of elements heavier than helium (referred to as metallicity). If funnelled to the centre of a galaxy, it will result in the central gas having an overall lower metallicity than gas further from the centre, because the gas further out has been enriched by supernovae and stellar winds, and not diluted by the primordial gas. Here we report chemical abundances across three rotationally supported star-forming galaxies at redshift z ≈ 3, only 2 Gyr after the Big Bang. We find 'inverse' gradients, with the central, star-forming regions having lower metallicities than less active ones, which is opposite to what is seen in local galaxies. We conclude that the central gas has been diluted by the accretion of primordial gas, as predicted by 'cold flow' models.},

abstract = {We present the results of a systematic search for galaxies in the redshift range z = 6-9, within the new, deep, near-infrared (Y, J, H) imaging of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field provided by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We have performed full spectral energy distribution fitting to the optical+infrared photometry of all high-redshift galaxy candidates detected at >=5$\sigma$ significance in at least one of the WFC3/IR broad-band filters. After careful rejection of contaminants, the result is a sample of 49 galaxies with primary photometric redshift solutions z > 5.9, within the 4.5 arcmin2 field covered by the new near-infrared imaging. Our sample, selected without recourse to specific colour cuts, reselects all but the faintest one of the 16 z850-drops selected by Oesch et al., recovers all five of the Y105-drops reported by Bouwens et al. and adds a further 29 equally plausible galaxy candidates, of which 12 lie beyond z $\sim$= 6.3 and four lie beyond z $\sim$= 7.0. However, we also present confidence intervals on our photometric redshift estimates, including alternative secondary redshift solutions. As a result of this analysis, we caution that acceptable low-redshift (z < 2) solutions exist for 28 out of the 37 galaxies at z > 6.3 and in particular for all eight of the galaxy candidates reported here at z > 7.5. Nevertheless, we note that the very highest redshift candidates appear to be strongly clustered in the field. Based on our photometric redshift analysis, we derive new estimates of the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function at z $\sim$= 7 and 8. Where our results are most robust, at a characteristic luminosity M1500 $\sim$= -19.5 (AB), we find that the comoving number density of galaxies declines by a factor of $\sim$=2.5 between z $\sim$= 6 and 7 and by a further factor of $\sim$=2 by z $\sim$= 8. These results suggest that it is difficult for the observed population of high-redshift star-forming galaxies to achieve re-ionization by z $\sim$= 6 without a significant contribution from galaxies well below the detection limits, plus alterations in the escape fraction of ionizing photons and/or continued vigorous star formation at z > 15.},

abstract = {A standard library of theoretical stellar spectra intended for multiple synthetic photometry applications including spectral evolutionary synthesis is presented. The grid includes M dwarf model spectra, hence complementing the first library version established in Paper I (Lejeune, Cuisinier & Buser 1997). It covers wide ranges of fundamental parameters: Teff : 50,000 K to 2000 K, log g : 5.5 to -1.02, and [M/H] : +1.0 to -5.0. A correction procedure is also applied to the theoretical spectra in order to provide color-calibrated flux distributions over a large domain of effective temperatures. For this purpose, empirical Teff-color calibrations are constructed between 11500 K and 2000 K, and semi-empirical calibrations for non-solar abundances ([M/H] = -3.5 to +1.0) are established. Model colors and bolometric corrections for both the original and the corrected spectra, synthesized in the UBVRcIcJHKLL'M system, are given for the full range of stellar parameters. We find that the corrected spectra provide a more realistic representation of empirical stellar colors, though the method employed is not completely adapted to the lowest temperature models. In particular the original differential colors of the grid implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes are not preserved below 2500 K. Limitations of the correction method used are also discussed.},

@article{Kobayashi2007,
abstract = {Using a new numerical model for cosmic chemical evolution, we study the influence of hypernova feedback on the star formation and metal enrichment history of the universe. For assumptions which produce plausible results in idealized collapse models of individual galaxies, our cosmological simulations of the standard Lambda-CDM cosmology show a peak of the cosmic star formation rate at z$\sim$4, with $\sim$10% of the baryons turning into stars. We find that the majority of stars in present-day massive galaxies formed in much smaller galaxies at high redshifts, giving them a mean stellar age as old as 10 Gyr, despite their late assembly times. The hypernova feedback drives galactic outflows efficiently in low mass galaxies, and these winds eject heavy elements into the intergalactic medium. The ejected baryon fraction is larger for less massive galaxies, correlates well with stellar metallicity, and amounts to $\sim$20% of all baryons in total. The resulting enrichment history is broadly consistent with the observed abundances of Lyman break galaxies, of damped Lyman alpha systems, and of the intergalactic medium. The metallicity of the cold gas in galaxies increases with galaxy mass, which is comparable to observations with a significant scatter. The stellar mass-metallicity relation of the observed galaxy population is well reproduced by the simulation model as a result of mass-dependent galactic winds. However, star formation does not terminate in massive galaxies at late times in our model, and too few dwarf galaxies are still forming stars. These problems may be due to a lack of resolution, to inappropriate modelling of supernova feedback, or to a neglect of other feedback processes such as active galactic nuclei.},
